Planting the seeds for better public-government engagement and services.”
“Our parliament’s perspectives on the national priorities, its disparities with the citizen’s needs and expectations and how better understanding of the public's needs can create a better future.”

“We are living in a digitised world!”, this is old news in 2021. Digital technologies have transformed the way we go about our everyday business - our banking is fully digitised, we make personal and professional connections on digital platforms and we order food at home with a few taps on our smartphone.

Could you name one key pillar of our democratic society that has completely fallen behind the digital curve? Parliament springs to mind - both federal and the state. The public’s engagement with parliamentary discussion remains mostly a one-way street that is hard for citizens to navigate. The information that does trickle down is diced up, packaged, and spun by layers of third-party news organisations and commentators.

When was the last time you were aware of the parliament discussion on a topic of interest to you? Did you make time to listen to the whole parliament session? Did you find the information that you were hoping to find? Did you want to fact-check the information but do not know where to start and then other priorities crept in?

SMRT Public Indexes of Engagement (SMRT - PIE) provides a digital platform for matching a person’s interests to the national discourse. It solves the issue of disparity between the citizen’s needs and public service design by targeting the information gap between citizens and elected officials.

The platform is designed to facilitate a better exchange of ideas, interests, and needs of Australians with all levels of government to inform better policy and service design. SMRT-PIE is a platform of two-way exchange, bringing government to the people and informing government about what matters most to the community. Citizens follow issues that they care about, learn which elected officials are most vocal on these issues, understand how their own elected official has voted on these issues, and discover open government datasets related to these issues. Elected officials can easily see which issues matter most to their constituents, and shape their actions accordingly. In this way SMRT-PIE establishes a feedback loop mechanism between citizens and their elected officials that updates with the changing attitudes, preferences and service needs of the citizens.
Value Proposition
Discovery: Discovering parliamentary discussions and announcements that are of interest to the Australian Public. Finding relevant information and announcements remains a challenge.

Transparent translation: Translating parliamentary discussion into topics of interest nominated by Australians and provided via digital mediums of choice. Providing the summary findings, statistics, and datasets on topics discussed in parliament and citizen’s engagement with these topics. No spin on the news other than the auto-generated Machine Learning summaries.

Growth: Scaling the public's engagement with parliament on their topic of interest - informing the public of discussions happening in every parliament in Australia. An open, privacy-conscious platform accessible to all citizens and all levels of the government. Feedback loop between the public and governments to constantly assess community challenges, expectations and aspirations.

Impact: Measured in the number of topics of interest generated by Australians, shifting public and private sentiments, and better/timely services designed for the public. Strengthening the public’s trust in our national institutions to better tackle the challenges of the future.
How does SMRT-PIE work?
The platform works by breaking down live parliamentary video streams into “information chunks”, finding the related public datasets accessible via ABS API, and picking out key data points such as the speaker and topic. The process can be broken into three applications as below.
Generating Information Chunks
In this step, the SMRT-PIE Engine - a series of machine learning (ML) algorithms and associated functions and storage - processes the parliament video stream into “information chunks” (60-second video snippets). The key steps include:
Real-time processing of parliamentary video streams.
ML algorithms identify the speaker.
Voice-to-text transcription of the video stream.
ML trained model matches the text transcriptions against topics of interest suggested by citizens (for example “environment”, “homelessness”, “covid”).
Creating “information chunks”: 60-second video and text summaries with data-points such as the topics of interest, a timestamp of the results, and details of the speaker. This is pushed to a database for storage.
The data generated in the process includes: Speaker Name, Topic of Interest, Video Stream link (start and end time), ML-generated summary of the discussion.

Matching with public datasets
In this step, the SMRT-PIE Engine matches the citizen’s topic of interest against the ‘metadata’ for public APIs such as ABS API (beta), data.gov.au, state government APIs, or even international public data available via Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX). The steps include:
ML model creates a layer of ‘meta-data’ for datasets accessible via public APIs.
ML model finds the closest match against topics of interest.
ML model saves the results in a database for later retrieval.

SMRT PIE WebApp - Smart Public Indexes of Engagement - GovHack 2021
This project is the frontend for the SMRT PIE platform. SMRT PIE uses machine learning and automated dataset analysis to help citizens better engage with government. At its core, SMRT PIE is a sophisticated series of machine learning algorithms (the SMRT PIE Engine) that analyses live streams from parliament and generates useful statistics about topics, speakers, and datasets that are discussed, then enriches this data by querying various government APIs. The SMRT PIE WebApp presents the analysis generated by the SMRT PIE Engine to users via a series of easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and visualisations.

Tech stack
This project is a VueJS web app built using Azure Static Web Apps, supported by two Python APIs, and backed by an Azure Cosmos DB database. The web app makes heavy use of Plotly.js, a Javascript charting tool that generates dynamic, responsive charts and graphs.

Data flow
The SMRT PIE Engine analyses parliamentary live stream footage, then combines it with open source government data to generate statistical analysis. This analysis is pushed to a database in the form of JSON objects.

##The SMRT PIE WebApp renders in the user's browser, making automated calls to 2 backend APIs. These APIs make calls to the database to retrieve JSON objects created by the SMRT PIE Engine. These JSON objects contain details about the day's parliamentary activity, the user's selected topics, and granular data about those topics. The SMRT PIE WebApp then depicts this data in an easy-to-consume way.

Future integrations
In future this web app will have login functionality using Azure Active Directory B2C for authentication. This will enable users to sign in and hence provide more privacy to their profile page. The user can then input basic information (such as their electorate) in order to visualise what their local parliamentarian has been discussing, and which datasets relate to topics in their local area. It will also allow the user to see which topics are of most interest to people living near them.
